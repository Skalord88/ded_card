## Character card for D&D 3.5
The goal was to develop a web application for creating character sheets for Dungeons & Dragons, specifically for edition 3.5. It encompassed all the rules and materials available for version 3.5, so the user can focus on the enjoyable task of creating diverse characters and leave the tedious calculations to the app.
